### How to setup:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shellywell123/Solar_System.git
```

### How to update:

```bash
cd Solar_System/
```
```bash
git pull
```

## Usage
```bash
python3 Solar_System.py
```

## Features
- approximate realtive distances and scale
- parallax back ground star
- adjustable orbits
- Animation coming soon

## Potential Goals
 - Image overlays for planet surfaces (will allow for planet rotaions to be visible)
 - live position of planets (animated + opt to pan through time)
 - make each dash of a planets orbit represent one day 
 - accurate eliptical orbits with processions (all obrits curently fixed inline with x axis)
 - accurate moons and rings
 - approximate star positions and brightnesses in background
 - could add satelites and space mission trajectories
