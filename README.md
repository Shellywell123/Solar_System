# Solar_System
Interactive 3D model of our Solar System plotted in matplotlib. Fun side project made to learn more about 3D animation in Python 3.

## Instructions:

### How to setup:
In terminal/cmd prompt, clone the repository into the desired location:
```bash
foo@bar:~$ git clone https://github.com/Shellywell123/Solar_System.git
```

### How to update:
Navigate to program directory & pull the latest version of the repo:
```bash
foo@bar:~$ cd Solar_System/

foo@bar:~$ git pull
```

### How to run:
In terminal/cmd prompt, execute 'main.py' with python 3:
```bash
foo@bar:~$ python3 main.py
```

## Features
- Approximately accurate orbital distances with scaled planet sizes
- Rendered surfaces of planets, moons and gas rings
- Asteroid belts
- Parallax background stars
- Runs on both Windows and Linux systems

## Current Features in Development
 - live positioning of objects
 - Rings don't currently render infont/behind planets correctly
 - Using aspect ratio 1:2 as axis doesnt scale with screen size

## Potential Goals
 - Image overlays for planet surfaces (will allow for planet rotations to be visible)
 - Live position of planets (animated + option to pan through time)
 - Make each dash of a planets orbit represent one day 
 - Accurate eliptical orbits with processions (all orbits currently fixed inline with x axis)
 - Approximate star positions and brightnesses in background
 - Add man-made satelites and space mission trajectories
